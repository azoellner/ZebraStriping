# Zebra Striping for Thunderbird

This Thunderbird add-on adds zebra striping to the folder and message lists, i.e.,
coloring of every other row of these lists to make them easier to read.

## Technical Notes

In older versions of Thunderbird, it was possible to achieve the zebra striping by
[adding CSS rules](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Zebra_striping) to the user profile's
_userChrome.css_ file. But with the changed implementation of the user interface in
version 115, this no longer seems to be feasible.
